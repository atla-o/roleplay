Roleplay is a pure digital simulation built from open elevation data with no land claim or ground impact. The basin is framed only as **Northern Canada (Polar Desert Basin, 4 × 4 km)**. It is published with the Creation division at [atlas.rehab](https://atlas.rehab/).

The measured window is EPSG:3413, X −1,116,740 m to −1,112,740 m, Y −1,136,011 m to −1,132,011 m. The centre is 75.3971°N, 89.509°W.

## ArcticDEM v4.1

Elevation is the public ArcticDEM v4.1 2 m mosaic (collection `arcticdem-mosaics-v4.1-2m`, STAC `https://stac.pgc.umn.edu/api/v1`), resampled to a 500 × 500 post grid.

Slope, closed-depression depth, and D8 flow accumulation are derived from the measured elevation grid. Derived flow lines in `hydro.geojson` are marked `derived-flow-accumulation` and are not NHN features.

## Viewer

The browser viewer uses [Three.js](https://threejs.org/) (MIT). Machine rates, permafrost detention, and the ninety-day growing window are sim parameters. Elevations in `public/data/` are the measured DEM.
